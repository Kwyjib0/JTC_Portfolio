### Projects:

- **Tip_Calculator**
1. This app takes user input for the cost of a meal, number of diners, and percentage user wishes to tip.
2. This data is used to calculate what the bill with a tax of 10% added is for each individual if divided evenly.
3. The user's desired tip amount is then calculated base on individual total cost plus tax.
4. The calculated tip is added to the individual's bill.
5. The individual total bill (meal + tax + tip) is then output for the user.
