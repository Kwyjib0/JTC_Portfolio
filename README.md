### Projects:

- **Tip_Calculator**
1. This app takes user input for the cost of a meal, number of diners, and percentage user wishes to tip.
2. This data is used to calculate the tax and tip and added to the total bill.
3. If there is more than one diner, the bill is divided evenly to find how much each individual owes.
4. The total bill and individual bill amounts are formatted to be output rounded to two decimal places and comma seperators.
5. The formatted total bill and formatted individual bill (if more than one diner) are then output to the user.
